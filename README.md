# Embedded_Project_Asteroid_Dodger
An embedded C project that simulates the "Asteroid Dodger" game on a 16x4 LCD. The code incorporates player input, asteroid movement, collision detection, and scoring mechanisms.

**Hardware:**
* Microcontroller: LPC2138
* Display: 16x4 LCD
* Buttons: Two push buttons (left and right)
* Resistors, capacitors (as needed)

**Software:**
* Development Environment: Keil uVision 
* Compiler: ARMCC C Compiler

**Game Features:**
* Player Control: Move the spaceship left and right using two buttons.
* Asteroid Movement: Asteroids are generated randomly and move down the screen at increasing speeds.
* Collision Detection: The game ends when the spaceship collides with an asteroid.
* Scoring: Points are awarded for each asteroid successfully avoided.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Hardware Setup:**
    * Connect the microcontroller, LCD display, buttons, and other components.
    

2. **Software Setup:**
    * Open the project in Keil uVision.
    * Compile the code.
    * Download the compiled `.hex` file to the microcontroller using a JTAG debugger or other appropriate method.

**Playing the Game:**
* Press the left and right buttons to move the spaceship and avoid the falling asteroids.
